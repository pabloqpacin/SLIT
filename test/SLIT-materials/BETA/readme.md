# *Self-Learning IT* ~ materials
<!--need to update w/ me GitHub stars-->

Hi there, welcome to my personal **IT Roadmap** üëã

July 2022 felt like time for a career change, thus I did sign up for ITEP's [Network and System Administration](https://www.itep.es/ciclos-formativos/distancia/tecnico-superior-administracion-sistemas-informaticos-red) studies. Unwilling to wait though, took a deep dive into **self-taught Software Development**.

üìö YouTube research was done and the algorithm was fairly spammy,  feeding me with quality content. Soon enough, [my playlists](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4yPJo9tFagP7ZMkMcCQNbw) were overwhelmed by the sheer amount and variety of content. Tried to keep all matters organized in a cross-platform fashion via Discord and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/selflearningIT/) severs, but my needs weren't met.

‚ú® Going through some 101s it became crystal clear: I figured **Git** and **markdown files** were all I needed. Now this very file is my self-taught roadmap, a custom wiki, my knowledge-base, my self-learning journal.

Now thanks for reading and I hope you'll find it useful too! You may fork this repo, add your own sauces and projects and share them with me! ‚õèÔ∏è
