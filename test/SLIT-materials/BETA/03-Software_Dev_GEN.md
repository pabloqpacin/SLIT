## FIELDS

- Computer Science
    - [Math needed for CS](https://youtu.be/eSFA1Fp8jcU)
- Data Science 
    - [What to Learn to get Hired as Data Scientist](https://youtu.be/pLI7T0clMxg)
    - [How I'd learn to code if I could start over](https://youtu.be/MHPGeQD8TvI) @ Tina Huang
        - **Learn Python** (friendly syntax, versatile, popular)
            - **First weeks:** Learn variables, datatypes [strings, floats, ints, arrays], loops, functions, if statements, OOP | RSS = [interactive websites [fCC, Codeacademy], video-tutorials, books] | Objective = implement fundamental concepts = play around and expand tutorials’ content
            - **Late personal projects:**  interesting/useful, small, ~~copypaste~~
                - (n01-04) - n01 '(array(database)), random output IF input(x,y)' | n02 'snake = basics+OOP+UI' | n03 'stock trading bot' | **arrays < Pandas pydata // data-frame** |**learn APIs // (beginner 2 advanced)**
                - then: algorithms and data structures [dictionaries, linked lists, queues, heaps, trees, graphs] ~~^^~~ BUILD a MAZE and an ALGORITHM to solve it
            - **Eventually:** Documentation, '+topics = +projects (WebDev, AppsDev, AI)'
        - **Mindset**: programmer = tinker(explore, dive-in) | problem-solving != StackOverflow | adaptability, constant learning, **growth mindset**
        - **Overkill:** do DEV in a certain community | *code = powerful tool, freedom to self-learn*

<summary> Industry Trends ~ 2022 is gonna be wild for Developers </summary>

[Developer Trends in 2022](https://youtu.be/LOpFYMPXqE4) @ Fireship

- *Web 3* = decentralized internet if smart contracts | crypto
    - No more passwords but blockchain wallet addresses **(browser plugin like metamask)** | d-app = code in the blockchain as smart-contract (data ownership) | tech is in early stages, as an industry it’s not worth the trouble, although if successful and mainstream, then AYE!
    - ***to-do*** ~~^^~~ 'Entirely decentralized news network, where journalists could upload video, articles and other reporting, and be compensated based on its reach *(basically a good Twitter)*. It would incentivize good journalism and eliminate the possibility of a top-down propaganda machine. Journalists win, consumers win, and the establishment gets f*.

- *Metaverse* = hyper-real alternative world
    - internet-based platform with multiple access points [phone, VR, AR]
    - users require one single profile to interact with [businesses, apps, other users…] in a virtual environment
    - dangerous tho, as it may enhance [addiction, isolation]
    - **tools [unity, unreal engine, blender]** ~~^^~~ (!!!)
    - ***to-do*** ~~^^~~ sorta *Squarespace* or *Shopify* for the **Multiverse** (ie. a platform for businesses)

* ### ~~Comment_IQ, Documentation & Portfolio ~~^^~~ [If You're Learning to Code STOP Taking Notes](https://youtu.be/VCWzQpUwsaw)~~ @ Dorian Develops

    - ~~^^~~ Prepare **CompTIA certificates**
    - *memorizing != retaining:* for first_tutorials don’t bother with notes |
    work through curriculum for 1-2 months building projects from scratch
    - **Commenting code:** everything relevant if not obvious | overkill = all variables, even single-lines | slowly develop Comment_IQ | **later, comment = all I write and copypaste from online rss** so I understand and explain the process
    - ~~^^~~ **Documentation:** always start with a README file | **learn markdown & WYSIWYG** | **explain project (technologies, codebase, purpose) | *Documentation = notes* |overkill = ['Getting started' section, Examples of code snippets, Demos of what library/app does] | learn from my tools’ Documentation [structure, content, ...]
    - *Conclusion:*
        - explain [code-blocks do, application does]
        - do what real world 'good software development teams' do
        - figure out what is worth holding on to and what isn’t
        - **memorize = muscle memory**
        - **my output to the world ==** notes for GitHub *(clean clear code, solid Docm.)*
        - remember employers like solid portfolio w/ all explained

<!-- key skill to level-up: Debugging -->

* ### ~~Analytical, creative & diffuse approach ~~^^~~ [Be a Better Programming by Mastering Debugging](https://youtu.be/DQEVZ5efnO0)~~ @ Andy Sterkowitz

    - **Key insights:**
        - **Computer Logic Understanding:** how to write instructions (code) for Computers to run Operations and return Output
        - **Programming** = bugs, errors (misspells, wrong references)... Avoid such by *commiting constantly*
        - **Debugging** is the assessment process of finding the cause for bugs in the code.
        - **Good debugger:** reads lots of code analytically, abstract thinker, 'code-doctor'

    - **Main points:**
        - **Mindset change**: if smth broken: from DOER to DOCTOR, be curious and inquisitive, slow-down and don't overlook
        - **Read error messages**: detailed info (where issue, what is it), copypaste online
        - **Use debugging tools**: aka surgery; breakpoints ~~^^~~ (!!!)
        - **General:**
            - Double check logic aka instructions
            - Assume human error: fight with clean code, tests;  question anything you may have written
            - Commit small changes: for consistant development
            - Take mental breaks: **'power-through approach' VS 'Diffuse Thinking'**

* ### ~~Focus, deep-understanding, needfulness & growth ~~^^~~ [7 Habits of Senior Software Developers](https://youtu.be/zivngNtLiuY)~~

    - **Focus:** one thing for a long time; avoid multi-tasking and task-switching
    - ~~^^~~ **Automation:** avoid repetition (in code)
    - **Pragmatism** (biznez perspective): look at the bigger picture; avoid over-engineer and *refactoring*
    - **Teach others:** Unconscious Competence + explain in simple terms = Refine Mental Models + Communication
    - ~~^^~~ **Open-Minded:** learn new [frameworks, languages] = build preferences; seek cutting-edge
    - **Seek feedback**
    - **Follow your interest:** stay motivated, fresh and happy == dive into new things

<summary> Problem Solving & Efficient Habits </summary>

* ### ~~Fitness, results, KISS & 'The Zone' ~~^^~~ [7 Habits of Highly Effective Programmers](https://youtu.be/W8ykZNSLDqE)~~ @ TechLead
    - **Intro:** right habits != burnout | long-term game == skills, tecniques; right career trajectory
    - **Fitness and sunshine:** because programming is physically demanding
    - **Results-oriented approach**: avoid *refactoring*; get projects done looking good
    - **KISS**: keep Code simple and consistant | *standarize* team methods | **all Code == read-write-debug easily**
    - **Getting in 'the Zone':** code and lose track of time = solid code (bc *large abstractions*) IF undistracted
    - **Sharpen yourself**: comfort zone == outdated | **key debug: adapt and diagnose**
    - **Collaboration:** share ideas | code integration in a team environment | networking
    - **Programming = solo:** lonely activity (code, documentation) in the digital world

* ### TDD & prototyping ~~^^~~ [Problem-Solving for Developers - A Beginner's Guide](https://youtu.be/UFc-RPbq8kg) @ Fireship

    <!-- {Case study — Using GraphQL and JS to merge 600 PRs} -->
    - (*^1) **Identify** ~ Understand the problem | *Documentation* = *Problem Statement* [context, situation/issue, why do we care]
    - **Research & Refine** ~ Visit StackOverflow and assess others’ approach | Break down problem into *subproblems*
    - **Pseudocode** ~ Outline the code to-be = *focus on logic, not syntax*; comment and name things
    - ~~^^~~ **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** ~ Helps understanding code & prevents regression | *'Red Green Refactor'*
    - **Implement** ~*Hackathon approach*: Done = tests_OK + prototype_OK
    - **Reflect on prototype** ~ Improve readability, name things better, add comments, remove duplication, optimize time/space complexity of algorithms, add *caching* to reduce cloud computing costs, improve error handling...
    - **Practice and repeat** ~ Infinite problems and challenges, so develop *intuitive skills*; get feedback

    <!-- {Dev Mindset — For programming, look at a problem and visualize how a computer system can solve it} -->
