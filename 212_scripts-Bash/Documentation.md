### Git stuff

Did *git init* in both GL76 (for this Documentation file) and EX2511 (for the actual scripts).

As of now, both are 'master' branches, but I need to upload a master branch and then split it into a branch per machine.

Now I have created a private GitHub repo. Following instructions, I do:
- 



## 1.0 ~ scripts 0 - n

## 2.0 ~ scripts n - n2
