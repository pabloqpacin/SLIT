## context
about to start [message flashing](readme.md#message-flashing)
video timestamp [1:03:12](https://youtu.be/dam0GPOAvVI)


honestly I'm a bit lost since it was **two days ago** that I did all current progress

it's gonna be fine tho

just need to carry on and perhaps visit the *readme* every now and then
## TO-DO

1. Change background color --> I don't want boring annoying white 
2. Maybe... figure out why the `{% with messages = get_flashed_messages(with_categories=true) %}` aren't highligthed same way as Tim. Is it the *theme*? ðŸ¤”
3.  Tweak flashed messages to f* with the user


## progress

### Message Flashing
- watch out with `data-dismiss`cuz not suggested
