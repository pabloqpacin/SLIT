# DRAFT

I have this fake PS3 controller, model CECHZC2U.

## connection

Cable --> **mini USB**
Bluetooth --> *YES*


## current situation

Just installed [Steam] on my [EX2511] [PopOS] [Linux] machine.

Let's see if I can get the controller to play 9 Parchments.

**STEAM** issues tho...
