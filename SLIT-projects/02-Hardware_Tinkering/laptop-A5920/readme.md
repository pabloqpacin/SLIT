See [devices](/SLIT-projects/02-Hardware_Tinkering/devices.md) for a complete specs' breakdown.

Following [this footage](https://youtu.be/3VqmHDNPWg8) (*MUST DOWNLOAD & SELF-HOST*), I start dissassembling the machine.

As of now, I have separate parts with a number of purposes:

|---|---|---|
|**A5920 HDD**|1 TB|upgrade to *n* GB SSD
|**A5920 RAM**|4 GB|upgrade?

|keyboard|
|optical_drive|
|monitor + network_card cables & 2 more cables
|'debris' x2||bin or substitute
|upper layer|
|bottom layer|**MOBO**


## future plans

Upgrade OR Repurpose ideas:

1. must upgrade --> **HDD to SSD**
2. *home_server*
      - what can be done on this regard?
      - best OS, memory?
3. *malware_lab*
