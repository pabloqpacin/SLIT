Currently...

## GL76 - Windows 10

## EX2511 - PopOS

OS may change after [EX2511] *memory upgrade* (from 4 to 16GB).

## A5920 - Ã˜

Currently PopOS but device is dissassembled. Current ideas for it:
- **homeserver**: running some [IoT](/SLIT-projects/02-Operating_Systems/III-IoT/readme.md) OS
- *retro-emustation*: running Retroarch etc.
