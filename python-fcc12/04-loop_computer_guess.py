BREAKDOWN
- Import RANDOM module.
- Print instructions.
- Define core GAME function with a later-defined X parameter.
    - var1 --> LOW end of numbers' range, in this case 1
    - var2 --> HIGH end of number's range, in this case 1000 (X parameter later defined as 1000)
    - var3 --> our FEEDBACK to the guessing computer, current value is irrelevant
    - WHILE loop --> as long as FEEDBACK is not "AYE"...
        - IF - LOW and HIGH don't match...
        (currently 1 and 1000, soon to be UPDATED in the LOOP)
            - var4 (GUESS) is generated --> RANDOM number between LOW and HIGH
        - ELSE... (!!!)
            - var4 GUESS becomes the var1 LOW (now LOW is the RANDOM number) (!!!)
        - var3 FEEDBACK becomes the user input because...
        - if FEEDBACK is "h", the var2 HIGH becomes GUESS-1
        - if FEEDBACK is "l", the var1 LOW becomes GUESS+1
        Let's explain that: (!!!)
    - finally, when FEEDBACK becomes "AYE" the LOOP breaks and the YAY f-String is printed.
- lastly, the GAME parameter X is defined as 1000, which in turns translates into the var2 HIGH.
