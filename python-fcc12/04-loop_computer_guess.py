Building from [03](https://github.com/pabloqpacin/SLIT/blob/main/python-fcc12/03-loop_user_guess.py)
---
DESCRIPTION
Python game where the user thinks a number (1-1000 or any range)
and the computer narrows down that range to guess our secret number.
We never declare our number, giving instead fair feedback to the guessing computer.
---
GRAMMAR
Besides using if-statements, f-strings, while-loops and the 'random' module,
we now introduce the 'socket' and 'getpass' modules, addressing environment_variables.
---
TWEAKS
Taking distance from the original tutorial, we've performed the following tweaks:
- included modules 'socket' and 'getpass' for custom f-strings
- thoroughly commented and explained all relevant code snippets
- reworked most of the printed text strings for sassier dialogue
- improved syntax for the `if low == high:` statement (ln 55)
    - now the loop also breaks if there's only one number to guess, hence declaring W for the machine
---
TO-DO
- devise cheats to bypass the while-loop and its 'yay' message

# [^1] As we provide fair feedback, the loop iterates and the variables are updated,
# steadily narrowing down the range for guesses until the loop is broken because
# there's only one possible guess or the last guess is actually correct.
