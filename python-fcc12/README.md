## Introduction

Today is Friday the 14th October 2022. However it was in July when I undertook this FCC12 project. I had never coded before, I didn't know what the terminal was and I was so confused when I heard of "python interpreter". Awe, me first steps ðŸ˜….

Well yes I uplodaded the project files to GitHub right after finishing the tutorial because sharing is caring... But tbf I didn't even use **git** back then and the project files are likely to be a pretty mess atm. So it is time to go through the video and the code again, customizing the files and commenting and explaining whatever is happening in each file. Let's-a-go!


## How to run the code

In a nushell, you need **python** and we are using **VSCode** to write our code, which includes terminal
integration for us to run and see our code.

## 01 - Madlibs - variables01

Disclaimer: drastically customized the script contents.

Core points:
- variables
- user input
- f-Strings
- print a scripted output with "{}" for variables integration
- use "\" for new lines, etc.
