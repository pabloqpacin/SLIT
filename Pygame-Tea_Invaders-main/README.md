# Pablo's "Tea Invaders (Pygame)"


My first Pygame ever! Screenshots coming soon. âœ¨

Whilst avoiding *Tutorial hell*, I did follow [Free Code Camp's](https://youtu.be/FfWpgLFMI7w) 'Space Invaders' python tutorial, as explained by [@attreyabhatt)](https://github.com/attreyabhatt/Space-Invaders-Pygame). Additionally, I developed a custom lives system.


As a result, you become AtatÃ¼rk and shoot gin-tonics to the Tea invaders.

Game's Over when the Teas reach the bottom of the screen, or when 7 shots miss the Teas and exit the screen, effectively counting lives off.

Thanks for reading aye! ðŸŒµ
