
still left to do:


- smoothen volume
  - lower bullet & explosion sounds
  - draft: `mixer.Sound.set_volume(0.2)`

- improve game screens:
  - START screen: feature the game title, high scores (only local for now...) and a START button
  - GAMEPLAY screen: include a pause option/keybinding
  - GAME_OVER screen: feature a RESTART button (programming a loop I suppose)


- feature different characters!!



you got any ideas, suggestions, complaints? let me know!
