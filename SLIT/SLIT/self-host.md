some ideas:

- self-host [[websyte]] to...
	- showcase projects
		- actual apps I built
		- with a repo of their own
	- ... in my $home server - homelab$ (HSH:)
		- much security - none vulnerabilities

<!--
- [ ] fix *TeaInvaders* 'screenshot issue' by deploying $websyte$ and selfhosting the screenshots there yay â€” linking GitHub file to screenshot file via web URL!
