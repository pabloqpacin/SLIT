## Current situation:

As of 14/11/2022, I have received an SMS from the same BBVA number which usually sends me bank transfer auth messages claiming:

```markdown
Nuestro sistema nos alerta de un pre-cargo no autorizado de 959,99 EUR con su tarjeta. Para cancelar el cobro sigue nuestro enlace: pagos.linusuales.com
```

So I have turned on the computer, opened an incognito Chrome window and accessed the URL `pagos.linusuales.com`.

I have literally gone into **DevTools** with `Control + Shift + I` and inspected the page.

## Current assessment

Webpage is suspicious but apparently legit according with the browser safety standards. Anyhow, I could not find much info via **DevTools** so I must learn 'bout it!
